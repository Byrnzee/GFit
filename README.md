# GFIt2

# To test our app use login details: admin password: 1234

Additional details:
Main activity 2 and main activity 2 xml are for authenticator which creates an account and put them in firebase authenticator but we didn't get it fully functional

Main activity and main activity xml are the database. you can create an account and it put it into firebase database with your username , password and email.
For testing purposes we did not link them so you could log in with your own username and password - instead use above login details.
